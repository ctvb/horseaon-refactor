# horseaon-refactor

In this project I changed some of the semantics, fixed the "search-engine-optimization" link so that it takes the user to the linked section when clicked, and condensed the css file.

This was done to make it easier to read and understand, to enable end users in properly navigating the webpage, and to make the css file easier to edit in the future.

The "search-engine-optimization" link was fixed by making it into an ID and the css file was condensed by putting items with the same specifications together.

In doing this I learned what to look for when working on links and how to condense a css file properly.
